# pandas-challenge

Completed the pycity schools challenge. Included is the jupyter note book file as well as a short written analysis commenting on two trends. 

Please note I was unable to obtain the overall passing percent, so to complete the tasks in which it was required I used the percent passing math as an alternate to show my ability to sort.
